For an overview, see https://github.com/ietf-ribose/bibxml-project.

This project uses Docker, Django and PostgreSQL.


Quick start
-----------

Please refer to the `local development environment setup <https://dev.bibxml.org/static/docs/howto/develop-locally.html>`_
section of the documentation.

You can browse documentation `in this repository <docs/index.rst>`_,
but as it makes use of Sphinx-specific directives unsupported by GitHub
it is recommended to `build documentation into HTML <docs/howto/develop-locally.rst#building-documentation>`_ first.
This can be done using Docker without any other dependencies.
