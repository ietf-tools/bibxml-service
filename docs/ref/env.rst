Environment variables read by web application
=============================================

The following variables are read from the environment
(either by Compose from shell where you execute ``docker compose``
or ``.env`` file, or by web application).

Variables marked as required or accepted by Django
are generally assigned to a member of :mod:`bibxml.settings`,
they can either influence a Django’s own setting
or service’s custom setting.

.. seealso:: :func:`bibxml.env_checker.env_checker()`

   - :doc:`/howto/run-in-production` for sample production environment


Service info
------------

``SERVICE_NAME``
    **required by Django** and Compose, pass-through

    The official name of the service. Short.

``CONTACT_EMAIL``
    **required by Django** and Compose, pass-through

    Email service operating team could be contacted via.
    May be used for exception notifications and more.

``SNAPSHOT``
    **required by Django**, provided by Compose, works as a Docker build arg.

    Version, taken from the latest Git tag.
    Can be obtained via `git describe --abbrev=0`.

    .. note:: In CI like GHA, repositories are cloned without history
              by default, in which case the above command will not
              return the latest tag. Possible workarounds:

              - Change clone behavior to full. This will make it slower.
              - Use another method of obtaining the latest tag.

                In case of GHA, the ``GITHUB_REF`` environment variable
                provides the pushed ref.
                You can set ``on: { push: { tags: ['*'] } }`` in your workflow,
                meaning builds only happen on pushed tags and ``GITHUB_REF``
                can be relied on to have tag name in it.
                It can be extracted with something like
                ``SNAPSHOT="${GITHUB_REF#refs/*/}"``.

``SOURCE_REPO_URL``
    accepted by Django and Compose, pass-through, recommended in production

    If provided, some pages of the service will show visitors a link
    to this source repository.

``SERVER_EMAIL``
    accepted by Django and Compose, pass-through, recommended in production

    For emails sent by the service directly,
    this will be used as the “from” address.


Web server
----------

``PRIMARY_HOSTNAME``
    **required by Django** and (as ``HOST``) by Compose

    Hostname used for Web GUI.
    HTTP requests with mismatching Host header will result in an error.

    Currently, it is used in ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting,
    as well as Crossref etiquette.

``INTERNAL_HOSTNAMES``
    accepted by Django and Compose, pass-through

    Alternative hostnames which could be used by internal services
    (e.g., in Compose configuration Prometheus refers to web container
    by its Compose hostname, so Django needs to recognize it).

``PORT``
    required by Compose

    Docker Compose will make Web GUI available
    on the host OS under this port number.

``RESPOND_TO_DETECTED_INTERNAL_HOSTNAME``
    accepted by Django

    If set to 1, Django will machine’s hostname detected at runtime
    to the list of ``INTERNAL_HOSTNAMES``.

``RESPOND_TO_DETECTED_INTERNAL_IPS``
    accepted by Django

    If set to 1, Django will machine’s IPs detected at runtime
    to the list of ``INTERNAL_HOSTNAMES``.

    Must be an absolute path.

    See :data:`bibxml.settings.DATASET_TMP_ROOT`.

``AUTO_REINDEX_INTERVAL``
    accepted by Django and Compose, pass-through

``EXTRA_API_SECRETS``
    accepted by Django and Compose, pass-through

    Extra tokens, as a single comma-separated string.

    Each will have the same effect and access privileges

    Controls public-side authentication requirement.

    If set to ``1``, the setting is set to ``True``.

       - :doc:`/topics/auth`

``DEBUG``
    accepted by Django and Compose, pass-through

    If set to ``1``, Django’s built-in ``runserver`` is used
    to serve the GUI, and error pages are verbose.

    It will also try to auto-detect IPs and hostnames and add them
    to ``INTERNAL_IP`` for Django debug toolbar to work
    in Docker environment.
